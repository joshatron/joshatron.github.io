                    <p>
                        I worked on the content team for TurboTax while at Intuit.
                        My main responsibility was to improve the tools that our tax analysts used to make them faster and more accurate.
                        I did this by speeding up tools, streamlining environment setup, and improving the UI they used.
                        <br/><br/>
                        One tool I improved was a web application which managed tax data.
                        The tool had an AngularJS front-end, with a Java Spring back-end.
                        My main improvements involved finding pain points and areas of limited functionality, then implementing the front-end and back-end solutions for them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Another tool I improved was a pre-release validation tool written in Java.
                        First, I streamlined the application, optimizing the threading and automating the environment setup.
                        Next, I added functionality, making the tool able to run without human assistance.
                        From those improvments, we were able to save over 600 hours of manual work annually.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Finally, I developed several optimizations to our testing frameworks.
                        Those improvements include optimizing threading, enhancing recovery from unexpected failures, and developing a system to only run relevant tests.
                        Overall, these improvements reduced average testing time by 75%.

                    <p>
                        I worked on the Gateway team in the Core Payments division of PayPal.
                        My main responsibilities included adding functionality, improving stability, and finding optimizations.
                        My team managed over 30 microservices that handled all calls going into and out of PayPal.
                        <br/><br/>
                        One initiative I worked on was migrating from ActiveMQ between microservices to async HTTP calls.
                        This allowed us to make fewer overall network calls, thereby reducing the overall time for each transaction.
                        Before the change, our gateway took 18ms to process, and after it took only 13ms.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Another initiative I worked on was adding more stability to our microservices.
                        I started by improving testing by adding unit, functional, and load tests.
                        I then used those tests to discover weak points and implemented fixes, reducing the frequency of crashes.

                    <p>
                        I spent the summer before my senior year of college doing a second internship at PayPal.
                        I once again worked in the Core Payments division.
                        My main focus was on a tool to help the developers on my team.
                        <br/><br/>
                        during the internship, I developed the back end of a web service for modifying JSON files in Git.
                        The development team managed a large number of JSON files, and any change required a lot of action.
                        A developer had to create several pull requests, release new versions, and update dependencies of several projects.
                        This was a major pain point, and slowed down development work.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The web service I worked on provided an online JSON editor.
                        Once the edit was complete, the service would make all the neccessary pull requests.
                        This saved about 90% of the time for the developer making the change, drastically improving productivity.
