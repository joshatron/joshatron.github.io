                        I am a full stack software engineer who is always trying to make everyone's life easier and more streamlined.
                        My passion is removing pain points and improving workflows.
                        I am also constantly trying to learn new things, whether thats a new framework, language, or design pattern.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I grew up in the Bay Area, but went to Montana State University to get my bachelor's in computer science.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Then I moved back to work at Paypal where I worked on their gateway team.
                        I worked mostly on optimizing and stablizing all our microservices.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In 2018, I moved down to San Diego to move in with my girlfriend.
                        I took an opportunity on the tax content at Intuit, working on creating and maintaining tool for tax analysts.
                        I learned a lot about working with consumers, and providing solutions that helped them out the most.
                        Unfortunately I was hired as a contractor, so could only work there for 18 months.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I managed to find a great opportunity though at the University of San Diego, working in enterprise applications.
                        I am excited to make a difference there.
                    </p>
