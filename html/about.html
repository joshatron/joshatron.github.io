                I am a full stack software engineer who is always trying to make everyone's life easier and more streamlined.
                My passion is removing pain points and improving workflows.
                I am also constantly trying to learn new things, whether thats a new framework, language, or design pattern.
                <br/><br/>
                I grew up in the Bay Area, but went to Montana State University to get my bachelor's in computer science.
                <br/><br/>
                Then I moved back to work at Paypal where I worked on their gateway team.
                I worked mostly on optimizing and stablizing all our microservices.
                <br/><br/>
                In 2018, I moved down to San Diego to move in with my girlfriend.
                I took an opportunity on the tax content at Intuit, working on creating and maintaining tool for tax analysts.
                I learned a lot about working with consumers, and providing solutions that helped them out the most.
                Unfortunately I was hired as a contractor, so could only work there for 18 months.
                <br/><br/>
                I managed to find a great opportunity though at the University of San Diego, working in enterprise applications.
                I am excited to make a difference there.
