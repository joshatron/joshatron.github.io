Personal Website
================

The goal of this website is to give a fuller description of my career in software than a resume could.
It includes a brief bio, descriptions of past jobs, and basic information on some of my personal projects.

The website is built as static HTML pages which utilize bootstrap for formatting.
You should be able to display it with any html server software.
The simplest way to navigate to the root folder and execute the run script.
